# Kai's part of the Get Parked Project

This repo contains LoRa setup instructions, Raspberry Pi instructions, and a 3D model of our Detection Unit Enclosure

The goal of this repo is to allow anyone to recreate our Get Parked project and have a good understanding of what we achieved in our 2023 Capstone Semester. Paired with the other repos under this account we have documented all of the software required to run Get Parked. 
I hope you enjoy discovering everything that we have completed here and I am so proud to have been part of this group.

Each of the subfolders has instructions for its corresponding title
